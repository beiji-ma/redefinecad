# RedefineCAD

> "We don't fix CAD. We redefine it."

RedefineCAD is an architectural rethink of how Computer-Aided Design systems should manage, govern, and evolve **design metadata**—not just geometry.

It is a layered specification, toolset, and philosophy aimed at:

- Making design metadata **durable**, **structured**, and **queryable**
- Supporting **versioning**, **traceability**, and **branching** without servers
- Enabling **automation** and **analysis** without requiring PDM/PLM platforms
- Empowering **individual designers** as well as **enterprises**

This is a multi-phase, long-term project that starts small—but is deeply ambitious.

## 📘 Overview

**RedefineCAD** is a long-term initiative to rethink how CAD data is governed, versioned, queried, and collaborated on — from first principles. Inspired by architectural patterns from databases (Oracle), source control (Git), operating systems (Linux), and real-world PLM platforms, this project introduces a layered, modular approach to CAD system design.

This repository contains:

- 📄 **Published Articles** (in `articles/`) — English-only, canonical source
- 🧪 **Drafts** of in-progress content — private repo: `redefinecad-drafts`
- 📚 **Resources & diagrams** — architectural visuals and templates

## 🌱 Philosophy

RedefineCAD is not a product — it’s a **conceptual framework**. We believe:

- CAD data should be governed like databases, not like drawing boards.
- Metadata, versioning, and collaboration should be **built-in**, not bolted-on.
- The future of CAD requires **queryable**, **auditable**, and **modular** systems.

We aim to define new standards for:

- Immutable storage and identity
- Schema-driven metadata governance
- Embedded query DSL for CAD metadata
- Local-first collaboration and revision logic
