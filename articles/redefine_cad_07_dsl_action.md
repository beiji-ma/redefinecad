# RedefineCAD-07: From DSL to Action

> **"Executable semantics" means your structure can *do* things‚Äînot just describe them.**

In this chapter, we explore the final piece of the semantic modeling triangle: **executability**.

---

## üéØ Why "Executable" Matters

Describing structure is useful.
Querying structure is powerful.
But when structure drives behavior‚Äîthat's when it becomes truly *semantic*.

- Traditional metadata: passive, descriptive only
- Semantic metadata: active, executable, drives automation

This is not about full-fledged workflow engines. It's about enabling **downstream automation** *by design*, via expressive and structured metadata.

---

## üî£ DSL as an Executable Contract

A DSL (domain-specific language) in RedefineCAD is not just for documentation or filtering.

It encodes *intent*.
And intent, when well-structured, can be transformed into *behavior*.

```xml
<CHECK_VIEW name="MainView">
  <CHECK_SESSION> ... </CHECK_SESSION>
  <MODEL_NAME> 'ABC123_PART' </MODEL_NAME>
</CHECK_VIEW>
```

This block is not a UI element. It's a **semantic instruction**. A runtime can:
- Validate if the referenced view exists
- Extract geometry for diffing
- Trigger report generation or transformation

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution Pipeline Design

The execution model has three layers:

1. **Parser**: Tokenizes and structures the DSL into an AST (abstract syntax tree)
2. **Validator**: Ensures that syntax and semantic constraints are satisfied
3. **Executor**: Performs domain-bound actions, e.g. export, diff, generate

Each action is modular and pluggable:

```python
class Action:
    def execute(self, context): ...

register("CHECK_VIEW", CheckViewAction)
```

This design allows:
- Incremental expansion
- Testing individual steps
- Debuggable pipelines

---

## üß™ A Minimal Example

DSL:
```xml
<CHECK_SESSION>
  <MODEL_NAME> 'PartX' </MODEL_NAME>
</CHECK_SESSION>
```

Executable Outcome:
- Locate `PartX` in metadata tree
- Validate presence of expected shape
- Export shape as neutral format
- Log result with pass/fail mark

> All driven by declarative metadata.

---

## üß∞ Engineering Implications

- Metadata is now an **active interface**
- UI is optional‚Äînot central
- Domain-specific actions decouple logic from platform

Unlike Low-Code platforms:
- Not tied to vendor GUI
- Not limited to webhooks or drag-drop automation
- Not targeting end-users, but **engineers** and **architects**

---

## üöß Future Directions

This approach enables:
- CLI-based validation pipelines
- Event-driven export engines
- Batch scripting across product trees
- Simulation-triggered reporting

And sets the stage for:
- **RedefineCAD-08: Semantic Agents** *(Coming soon)*
