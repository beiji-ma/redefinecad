# Why RedefineCAD?

RedefineCAD is not just a software project. It is a design philosophy, a provocation, and a thought experiment made real. We aim not to fix Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems, but to question and redefine their very foundations.

## The Motivation

Most CAD systems were born in an era when geometry was king. Everything else—metadata, attributes, relationships—was an afterthought. Even modern Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) platforms struggle to provide a coherent and expressive data layer for design metadata. Instead, they rely on fragile database schemas, oversized servers, proprietary APIs, and manual synchronization workflows.

RedefineCAD starts from a different premise:

> What if the CAD kernel was data-first? What if versioning, traceability, querying, and collaboration were embedded—not bolted on?

This question drives the design.

## The Origin

RedefineCAD is inspired by decades of struggle.

The author has worked with legacy PLM systems, proprietary CAD tools, and complex multi-site engineering environments. The pain points are consistent:

- Inflexible versioning
- Poor traceability
- Opaque metadata
- Heavyweight infrastructure
- Developer-hostile APIs

The goal is to break this cycle.

## The Design Influence

This project is not built from scratch—it is built upon proven ideas from other domains:

- **Git**: for decentralized versioning
- **Oracle DB**: for log-structured data storage and transaction safety
- **Unix**: for composable, small-core design
- **GitHub Actions**: for automation-driven pipelines
- **MQL / Gremlin**: for graph-style querying
- **CRDTs**: for collaboration without servers

We borrow, remix, and refine these concepts for CAD.

## Who It's For

RedefineCAD is for those who feel CAD systems are too heavy, too closed, or too hard to automate. It's for developers who want better abstractions. For architects who want cleaner design metadata. For makers, engineers, researchers, and dreamers.

We believe even small workshops and solo designers should benefit from rich metadata and robust versioning.

## The Commitment

We are not chasing hype. We are planting a tree. It may take years to grow. We’re okay with that.

If you're reading this and nodding, then RedefineCAD is already working.
