# RedefineCAD-01: Foundation and Motivation

> *“We don't fix CAD. We redefine it.”*

## 🚀 Vision: CAD Beyond Geometry

RedefineCAD is not just another CAD tool. It's an **architectural rethinking** of how Computer-Aided Design systems should manage, govern, and evolve design data in the age of distributed, collaborative, and intelligent engineering.

This project is inspired by decades of insights drawn from:
- 🧱 Oracle's data durability and transaction logic
- 🌳 Git's immutable storage and identity tracking
- 🧠 Linux's kernel and filesystem abstractions
- 📀 Real-world PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) needs in aerospace, automotive, and manufacturing

Our motto is simple:
> **CAD systems should govern data like databases, not like drawing boards.**

## 📦 Rationale: Why Redefine?

Most CAD systems suffer from:
- **File-based storage fragility** (loss-prone, hard to manage at scale)
- **Ad-hoc metadata** (weakly typed, inconsistently enforced)
- **Poor versioning semantics** (external PDM/PLM systems needed)
- **Fragmented collaboration** (no clear ownership, conflict resolution, or traceability)

RedefineCAD proposes a new foundation:

| Layer               | Concept                                        | Inspiration                       |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Physical Storage    | Append-only, block-based object store         | Git, Oracle Redo Logs             |
| Logical Structure   | Named parts, assemblies, revisions, constraints | RDBMS Tables + Version Control    |
| Metadata Governance | Typed, validated fields + provenance tracking | PLM systems + Git config          |
| Query Engine        | DSL for traversal, filtering, analysis        | SQL, JSONPath, Gremlin            |
| Collaboration       | Branches, conflict resolution, trust graph    | Git, CRDTs                        |

## 🧱 Design Principles

1. **Immutable Core**: All CAD data is content-addressed and append-only
2. **Schema-Driven Metadata**: Strong typing, validation, and field-level constraints
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Geometry ≠ Metadata ≠ Collaboration ≠ Query
4. **Local-First, Global-Safe**: Offline usage with sync and merge support
5. **Interoperable, Not Monolithic**: CLI-first, readable formats, API-based design

---

## 🔍 Use Cases (MVP Phase)

- Offline CAD metadata browser
- DSL-based structural queries (e.g., "find all parts with material = Aluminum")
- CLI tooling to analyze, validate, and transform CAD metadata
- Visualization of BOM trees and attribute propagation

## 🌱 Our Philosophy

This project is a long-term, layered redefinition. It’s not about shipping a product in 3 months. It’s about planting the tree:

> *"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."*

We plant this tree for future engineers.
